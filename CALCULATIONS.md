# CO₂ Emissions from Desktop Computer Usage

## Given Data
- Average power when in use: **200 W** (including speakers and printer).
- Daily usage: **8 hours**.
- Yearly energy consumption: ~584 kWh (≈600 kWh stated).
- Yearly CO₂ emissions: **175 kg**.

## Step 1: CO₂ per kWh
\[
\frac{175\ \text{kg}}{584\ \text{kWh}} \approx 0.2997\ \text{kg/kWh} \quad (\approx 300\ \text{g/kWh})
\]

## Step 2: Energy used in 1 second (when ON)
Power = 0.2 kW  
Time = 1 second = \( \frac{1}{3600} \) hours  

\[
E = 0.2 \times \frac{1}{3600} \approx 5.5556 \times 10^{-5} \ \text{kWh}
\]

## Step 3: CO₂ for that energy
\[
\text{CO₂} = E \times \text{emission factor}
\]
\[
\text{CO₂} \approx (5.5556 \times 10^{-5} \ \text{kWh}) \times (0.2997\ \text{kg/kWh})
\]
\[
\text{CO₂} \approx 1.665 \times 10^{-5} \ \text{kg} = 0.01665\ \text{g}
\]

## Final Approximation
**≈ 0.0167 grams of CO₂ per second**  
(or \(1.67 \times 10^{-5} \ \text{kg/s}\)) while the desktop is actively drawing 200 W.

## Notes
- Assumes constant 200 W draw during active use.
- Emission factor ≈ 300 g CO₂/kWh, based on given yearly data.
- If the computer is idle or sleeping, power use is lower, thus emissions drop proportionally.
- This is assuming that a desktop is being used
