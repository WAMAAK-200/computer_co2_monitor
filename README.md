# Computer Carbon Footprint Estimator
A Python program using TkInter that helps you track your computer usage and provides advice for how to make your computer usage as envinronmentally friendly as possible

NOTE: This won't be 100% accurate and uses a baseline of 0.0001 for carbon emission of a computer per second, this may vary from computer to computer where this number could either be higher or lower
For that reason, you may wish to apply your existing knowledge of your computer's specs in order to estimate whether or not this number would be higher or lower, where for that reason you may choose to adjust the baseline
This would especially be the case if you have a high quality graphics card
